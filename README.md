# WeatherPlot
It is a simple Python program showing a chart for time-to-time weather information in areas near HGU for the last two days.        
![plotImage](./image/plotImage.png)   
A x axle represents each time of the last two days.    
A left y axle represents the degree of temperatures and a right y axle represents the degree of humidity.    

# How to Execute?
Run the main.py That's it. Very simple!   

# Review
I was getting to make this program due to a kind of assignment. Because I haven't experienced in dealing with OpenAPI data, I had to try to do so many things in order to learn by myself. There were three main problems to solve, including getting JSON formatted datasets from the server, processing the data to extract only what I needed, and drawing the chart from the data. Fortunately, I spent all day today to solve these problems, and finally completed the functions and algorithms. I think my code examples could be helpful someday for beginners like me to learn by themselves, and I hope it to be helpful. Thank you.
